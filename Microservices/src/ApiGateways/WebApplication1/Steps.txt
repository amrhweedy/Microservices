1- install yarp reverse proxy package from nuget
2- register it in the program.cs and add the middleware for it 
3- define configurations in the app.settings.json like routes and clusters



"ReverseProxy": {
    "Routes": {
      "route1": {
        "ClusterId": "cluster1",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "{**catch-all}"
        }
      }
    },
    "Clusters": {
      "cluster1": {
        "Destinations": {
          "destination1": {
            "Address": "http://localhost:6000/products"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  this configuration means that when i write in the postman https://localhost:5054   it will directs to http://localhost:6000/products
  so when i write https://localhost:5054/1 it will direct to http://localhost:6000/products/1 to get the product 1
